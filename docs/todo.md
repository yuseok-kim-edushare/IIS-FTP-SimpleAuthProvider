Okay, I will analyze the provided codebase files and the `design.md` document to see how well the current implementation aligns with the design goals and identify areas for improvement and remaining work.

Based on the provided files and the `design.md` document, here's an analysis:

**Alignment with Design Goals and High-Level Architecture:**

*   **Native IIS Integration:** The `SimpleFtpAuthenticationProvider.cs` and `SimpleFtpAuthorizationProvider.cs` implement the `IFtpAuthenticationProvider` and `IFtpAuthorizationProvider` interfaces from `Microsoft.Web.FtpServer`, indicating native IIS integration as planned.
*   **Zero Dependency on Windows/AD accounts:** The user store (`IUserStore`, `JsonUserStore`, `UserManager`) and authentication logic (`PasswordHasher`, `SimpleFtpAuthenticationProvider`) operate on custom user data, achieving this goal.
*   **Security First:**
    *   `PasswordHasher.cs` uses `Rfc2898DeriveBytes` (PBKDF2) with configurable iterations (defaults to 100,000), aligning with the design. It also includes a constant-time compare (`CryptographicOperations.FixedTimeEquals` or a manual implementation for older .NET).
    *   `FileEncryption.cs` provides support for DPAPI-NG and AES-GCM with an environment variable key, covering encryption at rest.
    *   Salts are generated and stored per user (`User.cs`, `UserManager.cs`).
*   **Hot-reload of user store:** `JsonUserStore.cs` implements hot-reloading using `FileSystemWatcher` and `Interlocked.Exchange` for atomic cache replacement, matching the design.
*   **Simple DevOps story (CLI + CI build):** A `UserManager.cs` class exists in the `Core.Tools` directory, intended for CLI operations (`CreateUser`, `ChangePassword`, `ListUsers`, `AddPermission`, `GenerateEncryptionKey`, `EncryptUserFile`, `DecryptUserFile`). This aligns with the CLI part of the DevOps goal. The CI build aspect is mentioned in the design document but not present in the provided code files.
*   **Data Model:** The `User.cs` and `Permission.cs` classes match the data model described in the design document.
*   **User Store Abstraction:** The `IUserStore.cs` interface matches the one defined in the design document. `JsonUserStore.cs` provides the initial JSON implementation.
*   **Crypto & Security:** The implementation in `PasswordHasher.cs` and `FileEncryption.cs` largely follows the principles outlined. The use of BCrypt P/Invoke in `FileEncryption.cs` for AES-GCM ensures compatibility with .NET Framework 4.8.
*   **Configuration:** `AuthProviderConfig.cs` defines the configuration structure, and `UserStoreFactory.cs` attempts to load it from a file, falling back to legacy settings. This generally aligns with the configuration goals.
*   **Repository & Build Layout:** The provided directory structure (`src/AuthProvider`, `src/Core`, `tests`) matches the intended layout.

**Remaining Design Goals / Future Work (based on `design.md`):**

*   **Optional `Group` entity for permissions:** The data model section mentions the optional introduction of a `Group` entity for permissions, which is not currently implemented.
*   **Encrypted Azure Table back-end for `IUserStore`:** The design lists SQLite and Encrypted Azure Table as potential back-ends. Only `JsonUserStore` is implemented.
*   **Rate-limiting documentation (IIS FTP throttling):** The design mentions leveraging IIS built-in throttling; this is documentation/configuration work rather than code implementation in the provider itself.
*   **Comprehensive Testing Strategy (unit, integration, security):** The design outlines unit, integration, and security testing. The provided files are implementation, not tests, so this aspect is not visible but is a remaining goal.

**Documentation Status:**
*   README now includes:
    - Shields (build status, license, NuGet)
    - Quick Start
    - Configuration examples
    - Security notes (hashing algorithm, key rotation)
    - CLI usage examples
    - Contributing guide
    - License

**Code Quality Improvement Suggestions:**

*   **Asynchronous Operations:** The `IUserStore` interface and its `JsonUserStore` implementation use synchronous methods (`Find`, `Validate`, `GetPermissions`). The design document section 4 shows an *asynchronous* interface (`FindAsync`, `ValidateAsync`, `GetPermissionsAsync`). Updating `IUserStore` and its implementations to be asynchronous (`Task`-based) would align better with modern .NET practices, especially if adding I/O-bound operations like database access later. This would require changes in `SimpleFtpAuthenticationProvider.cs` and `SimpleFtpAuthorizationProvider.cs` to call the async methods.
*   **Dependency Injection:** While the providers use constructor injection internally (`internal SimpleFtpAuthenticationProvider(IUserStore userStore, AuditLogger auditLogger)`), the parameterless public constructors required by IIS (`public SimpleFtpAuthenticationProvider()`) currently instantiate dependencies directly via `UserStoreFactory.Create()` and `UserStoreFactory.GetAuditLogger()`. This makes the providers less testable and tightly coupled to the factory. A proper dependency injection container setup, if possible within the IIS extensibility model, would be an improvement. If not, the factory could potentially be improved to allow injecting dependencies for testing, maybe through static properties or a more complex initialization.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   `JsonUserStore.Load` catches generic `Exception` and swallows it, only mentioning that it should be logged in production. Specific exception handling and robust logging are needed.
    *   `SimpleFtpAuthorizationProvider.GetUserAccessPermission` catches a generic `Exception` and logs it via `_auditLogger.LogUserStoreError`, which is good, but could potentially differentiate error types.
    *   `AuditLogger`'s fallback to `Debug.WriteLine` if `EventLog` fails is a reasonable approach for non-admin scenarios, but robust logging frameworks (like Serilog or NLog) offer more flexibility and destinations.
*   **Configuration Loading:** `UserStoreFactory.LoadConfiguration` also catches a generic `Exception` during config file loading. More specific exception handling (e.g., `FileNotFoundException`, `JsonException`) and logging would be beneficial.
*   **BCrypt P/Invoke in `FileEncryption.cs`:** While necessary for .NET Framework, the direct P/Invoke calls to `bcrypt.dll` are complex and error-prone. If supporting .NET Core/.NET 5+ becomes an option, leveraging the built-in `System.Security.Cryptography.AesGcm` class would be simpler and safer. The current implementation is impressive for .NET Framework, but the interop code is dense and less readable.
*   **`UserManager.cs`:**
    *   Error messages are written directly to `Console.WriteLine`. For a CLI tool, this might be acceptable, but for a library (`Core.Tools`), returning results or using a logging mechanism would be better practice.
    *   The `LoadUsers` and `SaveUsers` methods in `UserManager` duplicate some of the JSON handling logic present in `JsonUserStore`. Consider consolidating this logic or using a shared helper class if possible, although `JsonUserStore` has hot-reloading concerns that `UserManager` might not.
*   **Code Duplication:** NormalizePath logic could potentially be reused if needed elsewhere.
*   **Nullability:** Nullable reference types are enabled, which is good. Ensure consistent use and handling of nulls throughout the codebase.

**Summary of Suggestions:**

1.  **Implement Async Operations:** Update `IUserStore` and `JsonUserStore` to use `Task`-based asynchronous methods as suggested by the design document, and update the providers to call them.
2.  **Improve Dependency Management:** Explore options for a more robust dependency injection approach for the providers, potentially involving the `UserStoreFactory` or an external container if compatible with IIS extensibility.
3.  **Refine Error Handling and Logging:** Implement more specific exception handling and ensure all errors are logged appropriately, especially during file operations and configuration loading. Consider using a more flexible logging framework.
4.  **Implement Remaining User Store Back-ends:** Add implementations for SQLite and potentially Azure Table Storage as specified in the design, adhering to the `IUserStore` interface.
5.  **Create Management CLI Project:** Build the `ManagementCli` executable project to expose the `UserManager` functionality as a command-line tool.
6.  **Implement Key Rotation Command:** Add a method to `UserManager` and expose it via the CLI to handle encryption key rotation.
7.  **Implement Metrics:** Add code to track and expose metrics (e.g., authentication success/failure) using a mechanism compatible with Prometheus textfile collector.
8.  **Add Group Entity:** Introduce the `Group` entity and update the data model, user store, and authorization logic to support group-based permissions.
9.  **Add Comprehensive Tests:** Write unit, integration, and security tests as outlined in the design document.
10. **Review `FileEncryption.cs` for .NET Versioning:** If targeting .NET Core/.NET 5+ is an option in the future, refactor `BcryptAesGcm` to use the built-in `AesGcm` class.

These suggestions will help complete the remaining design goals and improve the maintainability, testability, and robustness of the codebase. Let me know which of these you'd like to start working on!
