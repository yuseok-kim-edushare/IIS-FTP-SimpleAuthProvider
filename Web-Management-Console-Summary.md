## 🚀 Technical Implementation

### Dependency Injection (Unity)
- Configured Unity container for clean architecture
- Interface-based design for testability
- Proper lifecycle management for services

### User Store Integration
- Works with existing JSON, SQLite, SQL Server, and Esent stores
- Hot-reload support for configuration changes
- Encryption support with environment variable keys

### Unit Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite with MSTest and Moq
- Tests cover authentication, user management, and system health
- Demonstrates proper mocking and dependency injection

## 📱 User Interface Screenshots

The web interface provides a professional experience:

### Dashboard View
- Clean metrics cards showing system statistics
- Recent activity table with timestamped events
- System health indicators with status colors
- Quick action buttons for common tasks

### User Management
- Responsive data table with search functionality
- Inline action buttons (Edit, Change Password, Delete)
- Permission badges showing access levels
- Pagination for large user sets

### User Creation/Edit Forms
- Modern floating label inputs
- Dynamic permission row management
- Real-time validation feedback
- Consistent form styling

## 🔧 Deployment

### IIS Configuration
1. Create new IIS application or virtual directory
2. Set application pool to .NET Framework 4.8, Integrated mode
3. Configure HTTPS binding (required for security)
4. Set appropriate file permissions

### Application Configuration
```xml
<appSettings>
  <add key="UserStore:Type" value="Json" />
  <add key="UserStore:Path" value="C:\inetpub\ftpusers\users.enc" />
  <add key="AllowedAdmins" value="admin1,admin2" />
</appSettings>
```

### Environment Variables
```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("FTP_USERS_KEY", "your-encryption-key", "Machine")
```

## 🎉 Benefits Over CLI

1. **User-Friendly**: Intuitive web interface vs command-line complexity
2. **Visual Feedback**: Real-time validation and status indicators
3. **Accessibility**: Web-based, accessible from any device
4. **Audit Trail**: Visual activity log with searchable history
5. **Permission Management**: Dynamic form for complex permission sets
6. **System Monitoring**: Real-time health and metrics dashboard

## 🔍 Code Quality

- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with proper layering
- **Interface-Based Design**: Testable and maintainable code
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling and user feedback
- **Validation**: Both client and server-side validation
- **Security**: Following ASP.NET security best practices
